# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **personal web portfolio** created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and a touch of JavaScript (planned). It showcases my profile, technical skills, hobbies, and project experience — all structured into a clean and responsive design.

## 🚀 Deployed on AWS

The website is **deployed on the AWS Cloud** using **Amazon S3 static website hosting**. AWS S3 offers scalable, durable, and globally accessible cloud storage — perfect for hosting static websites like this.
